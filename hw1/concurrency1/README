We have included a makefile for ease of compilation. Running 'make' will
produce an executable named 'hw1'. Our program requires passing the number
of threads as an argument, and will be used for both consumer and producer
threads. That is if you pass in '10', there will be 10 consumer threads
and 10 producer threads for a total of 20 threads.

Example:

$ make
$ ./hw1 10
