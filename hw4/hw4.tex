      This document provides an overview of the work done by Group 11-09 for Project 4: The SLOB SLAB.
      It includes the design we used to implement the encryption algorithm.
      This includes answers to questions asked in the assignment description, a work log, and the git version control log.

\section{Project 3}

\subsection{Design}

% Talk about the design and algorithm here
The existing SLOB allocator uses a first-fit algorithm. What this means is that the first available page with enough memory is used for allocation.
To change this into a best-fit algorithm, we will change the algorithm so that it does not stop and allocate upon finding a suitable page.
Instead, the list will be iterated through in search of a suitable page, and each time a more suitable page is found it will choose that one instead.
% To test, we will


\subsection{Answers}

\subsubsection{What do you think the main point of this assignment is?}

We think that the main point of this assignment was to learn how the Linux kernel allocates memory, particularly with the SLOB allocator.
In this assignment, we modified the SLOB allocator algorithm from a first-fit to a best-fit algorithm, in hopes to optimize performance and avoid memory fragmentation. \\


\subsubsection{How did you personally approach the problem? Design decisions, algorithm, etc.}



To design a working implentation for the best-fit allocation algorithm, we first inspected the existing slob.c code to see how the first-fit algorithm worked.
We saw that the slob was iterating through the list of partially free pages, and skipping allocation attempts for pages that didn't have enough room until a suitable page was found.
To change this to a best-fit algorithm, we moved the allocation attempt to outside the list\_for\_each\_entry() iteration, and added a new variable sp\_best that holds the current most suitable page.
Upon iterating through the whole list of partially free pages, the most suitable page would be found and an allocation attempt could be made to it. If no suitable page was found, then a new page is allocated. \\


\subsubsection{Testing Details}

% TESTING DETAILS
To test our implementation, we included two syscalls that return free memory and used memory. These were defined as mem\_free and mem\_used.
We created a test program that prints fragmentation and free/used memory. We used this to compare the fragmentation differences between the two algorithms. \\



\subsubsection{What did you learn?}

Overall, we learned about the SLOB allocator in the Linux kernel and how the kernel allocates memory.
We also learned about first-fit and best-fit algorithms, and how a best-fit algorithm can avoid loss of performance. \\


\subsection{Work Log}
We came up with our design on the afternoon of June 8th and began work in the evening. We implemented our changes to the SLOB algorithm and worked on testing the next morning.
